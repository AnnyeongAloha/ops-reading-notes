# Introduction to Help Desk Support Roles 

## IT Staff: To include all personnel that work directly with users and clients, and those who work to keep server and network infrastructure fully operational. 

###     The way that I understand it, it's pretty much knowing how to talk to people, understanding the problem at hand, and coming up with a solution together so both ends are satisfied with the solution. On the infracture side, you're working with the technical skills that you have as well as communicating with your team through whatever communication channels available to you. 

## Hard Skills vs. Soft Skills

### Hard Skills: more specific, measurable skills (e.g. configuring and troubleshooting systems)
### Soft Skills: ability to communicate effectively with others 

Having a mixure of both can help land higher- level positions. Lack of contrast can do the polar opposite.
